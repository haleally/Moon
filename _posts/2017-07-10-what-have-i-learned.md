So, what have I learned so far in INLS 161?

It all kind of, to me, sums down to "wow, the internet is way more complicated than I thought."

And thank you to the internet gods before me that figured all this stuff out, and thank you to the guys who sit and youtube how to do literally everything you'd ever need to know so I can save myself from asking the class dumb questions.

This stuff is definitely more difficult that I expected, and I struggled in COMP 116 learning MATLAB so I was hesitant when I knew we would be doing similar coding-like things.

But thankfully, with a good teacher, good notes, and the aforementioned youtube guys, it's been alright.

I have learned how to make this post, including how to make this look like *this* and like **this** and even like ***this***. Incredible.

I've learned way more as well, but I'm still getting the hang of and wrapping my brain around the stuff we do on CodeAnywhere and I'm not sure if I'm really in a good enough place to say I've "learned it" yet, but soon.
