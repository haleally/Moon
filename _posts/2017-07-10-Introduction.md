My name is Haley and I am a rising senior studying Environmental Science at UNC Chapel Hill. During the summer of 2017, I am taking an Information and Library Science class as part of my major requirements in the hopes that I will be able to apply what I learn to better comunicate environmental issues to the public.

Here's a picture of me doing the **science**:
