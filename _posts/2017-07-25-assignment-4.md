## Assignment 4

The fourth assignment focuses on implementing what I've learned about **scripting**, **SQL**, and creating **datasets**.

Here's a link to the forked repository: ![Assignment 4](https://github.com/haleally/task-4-data)

I created two .sh files, the first of which contained a small 5-question survey used to collect data.
The questions were: 
1. What is your first name?
2. What color are your eyes?
3. What country were you born in?
4. Have you ever had a dog?
5. How old are you?

These questions accepted the inputs and were concatenated with a Timestamp and a Unique identifyer into a database. 

In the second script, a SQL database is set up and the data from the first script is entered into it. The database is dumped into a .sql file which houses all of the survey responses. 

This assignment taught me a quick and fairly easy way to create databases from user input. The survey was simple and only used for this assignment, but it is easy to make the connection to how this could be used for more complex and meaningful projects.
