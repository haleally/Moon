<h1>Assignment 5</h1>
<h2>Powerpoint Sucks</h2>

Assignment 5 focused on creating a presentation using the Reveal.js format. This skill is valueable because reveal.js is more accesible and malleable than Powerpoint, and you can therefore show your presentation more easily to others as well as make it more exactly what you want in terms of style and how it will look

My presentation: [Haley's final presentation](https://github.com/haleally/task-5-presentation)

My reveal.js focuses on my summer internship at the Southeast Regional Climate Center where I am an undergraduate research intern working on a project focused on determining if high heat index values are causing women to deliver babies preterm, before the 36 week gestation mark. 

Seeing as this is the final assignment, I'm not sure how often (or if ever) I'll get back onto Github and CodeAnywhere. But, I am now confident that I would be able to if the challenge ever presented itself. I learned a lot about information science in this course, obviously, but I also learned to be more confident in myself when presented with tasks that seem daunting and that I don't think I can complete. 
The politics of information was also super interesting to learn about. 

Thanks for everything, John!
